# Fun-Facts
This is my first published app I made by following the Treehouse tutorial and then made some modifications on my own. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wordpress.dylanmatthew.funfacts

Who doesn't love learning a couple new fun facts? Start an interesting conversation with a stranger on the bus, play a new guessing game on family night, or simply impress your friends with all your random knowledge, Fun Facts is the perfect app for those of us who can always use some new, unconventional information.

This app was created by following along with the Android course on treehouse.com with some slight modifications. I added Next and Previous buttons to cycle through the facts manually as well as some Toast messages to give it more usability.

If you have a problem on your device, suggestion for a new feature, or even just a favorite fun fact that you don't see in the app yet, drop a comment or send me an email at sandersd27@gmail.com! This is my first published app and I want to make this as great as possible for you!

More facts will be added very soon!
